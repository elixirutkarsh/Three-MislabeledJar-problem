# Three-MislabeledJar-problem
Step 1: Identify the jars:
Label the jars as Jar A, Jar B, and Jar C. Assume they are currently labeled as Jar 1, Jar 2, and Jar 3, respectively.

Step 2: Make initial statements:
Take one random marble from Jar 1, two random marbles from Jar 2, and three random marbles from Jar 3.

Step 3: Analyze the marbles:
Now, compare the marbles you've taken with their respective jars. Since all the jars are mislabeled, you can conclude the following:

The jar from which you took only one marble must be Jar B since it contains two marbles.
The jar from which you took two marbles must be Jar C since it contains three marbles.
The jar from which you took three marbles must be Jar A since it contains only one marble.
Step 4: Correct the labels:
Now that you know which jar is which, you can relabel them correctly:

Jar A should be labeled as Jar 2.
Jar B should be labeled as Jar 3.
Jar C should be labeled as Jar 1.
